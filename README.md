About this project:
-------------------
This is just a simple game engine that I'm making using pygame. Mainly just a test of how good the physics stuff we're doing at school actually works in practice. But also good programming practice. 

Versioning:
-----------
File versions are named upon each release of the file, so if a file is not edited between releases, it's version will stay the same. 

Project status:
---------------
The project is currently UNDER DEVELOPMENT and is not in a state for release yet. I'll try and keep track of future goals as well as I can.
